# Log Cleaner for iThemes Security (WordPress)

In a recent update, iThemes removed the ability to delete all database logs ([see this thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/latest-update-missing-a-button-to-clear-logs/)). This plugin gives you that control back.

**Note: This WordPress plugin comes with absolutelty no warranty of any kind. Although it has passed my own testing on a handful of websites, using it is at your own risk. Backup your database first just in case.**
